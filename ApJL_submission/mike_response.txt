More detailed responses...I'm doing this now because I'm angry.  I don't understand the whole "less restrictive models" point.  WTF does that mean?  It's already got enough free parameters. Furthermore, we mention numerous other tests we performed (with quenching, with more complex clouds/hazes etc.).  I don't know exactly what they want for this.  Also, they don't seem to get the chemically-consistent concept in the models.

1) In response to my second comment, the authors write "WASP-107b *is* different from previous cases because it has a cooler equilibrium temperature (780 K). At these temperatures, methane is expected to be the dominant carrier of carbon atoms (see Figure 7 of Moses et al. 2013, ApJ, 777, 34). Since methane has strong features in the WFC3 bandpass, we are able to constrain the C/O ratio robustly. This is in contrast to other higher-temperature planets, where the dominant carbon-bearing molecules are CO and CO2. These molecules have strong features in Spitzer photometric bands, but they are not spectroscopically resolved, making it more challenging to infer C/O for these planets than it is for WASP-107b."

The authors are correct in that WASP-107b is cooler (780K) than many hot exoplanets studied, but it is simply not true that this will enable "to constrain the C/O ratio robustly" with the wavelength range provided just because the planet is slightly cooler. On the contrary, it is quite likely that significant amount of carbon should be EXPECTED in other forms at the temperature encountered in WASP-107b's atmosphere, notably CO. WASP-107b is right at the transitional temperature between CO and CH4. 

Note to Laura**
Methane is the dominant carbon bearing species at T<1000K deeper than 1 bar.  Methane dominates over CO at 700K deeper than 1 mbar.   We could emphasize that at these temperatures methane will be at least as abundant as CO, the TP profile straddles the CO-CH4 stability curve.  Being on the "CO" side doesn't mean there's "no methane", it means that methane isn't as abundant.  Temperatures would have to get hotter than ~800K to start to fall below detection. Figure 3 in the original proposal illustrates this.  

My Response:

At these temperatures CH4 is one of the more dominant bearing carbon species (e.g., see Line & Yung 2013; Line et al. 2011...also, the example of GJ436 which is of comparable temperature and also has a lack of methane beyond what is expected, though due to high metallicity--Moses et al. 2014; Morley et al. 2017). Well yes, at certain pressures CO may be dominant, but integrated over the column CH4 is at least as abundant as CO.  Furthermore, given the abundance of methane, in chemical equilibrium at solar composition, over the WFC3 band-pass methane should be rather dominant.  Therefore, over the WFC3 pass-band there is the possibility, if methane is present, as expected, to present itself in the spectrum. Therefore, one can measure the relative abundances of a carbon-bearing molecule (CH4) and an oxygen bearing molecule (H2O) over the WFC3 bandpass, hence obtaining a robust C/O constraint.  CO on the other hand, at solar compositon will not show up at these wavelengths as the band is too weak.

Furthermore, the retrieval, as stated in the text, uses the "chemically-consistent" method. This means that the mixing ratios of water, methane, CO, CO2...etc., are calculated in thermochemical equilibrium at the temperature at that MCMC step in the retrieval. Therefore, on-the-fly retrieval chemistry takes into account the equilibrium partitioning between CO and CH4 at different temperatures. Because of the temperatures required by the retrieval to match the scale height of the atmosphere (which has a different influence on the shape than do clouds...e.g., see Line & Parmentier 2016) are cool (<~1000K), methane is the dominant carbon bearing species. In order to reduce the methane abundance, chemically, the retrieval must reduce the C/O ratio.  While yes, increasing the temperature will in fact deplete the methane abundance, at solar C/O ratio, however higher temperatures are not favored by the amplitude of the spectral feature.  


2) This brings up the main shortcoming of the letter as it is right now. The results in Figure 4 are presented for chemical equilibrium under the assumption of a temperature profile parameterized by the analytical form of Guillot 2010. This is overly restrictive and the resulting posterior distributions of C/O in Figure 4 are likely strongly affected by this restriction. The authors responses do not provide ANY additional analysis beyond the ones provided in the first submission. The authors only added that the methane abundance is in disagreement with equilibrium abundance of methane "at 700 Kelvin and 10 mbar". That is a very special case in a very sensitive region near the CH4/CO transition and we do not know what the exact photospheric temperature is. How does that comparison at 800K and 0.1mbar, for example? No methane and lots of CO should be expected. What happens if there is a thermal inversions? The data also indicates that there are clouds. Under these conditions, the authors should not restrict the models to Guillot 2010 temperature structures, but allow for a much wider range of temperature structures. 

My Response:**in fact maybe just showing the proposal Figure 3 to the reviewer would help
Transit transmission spectra are largely sensitive to temperature via the scale height effect. Given the narrow pass band,  the vertical temperature structure is not readily constrained (e.g., Lee et al. 2012; Barstow et al. 2013).  We therefore argue that the Guillot 2010 parameterization is sufficient.  Again, molecular mixing ratios are computed self-consistently along a given TP profile within the Guillot 2010 parameterzation (of which the irradiation temperature is a free parameter).   The upper atmospheric temperature (~1bar - 0.1 mbar) is primarily what governs the scale height over the region of the atmosphere probed by the transmission spectrum.    The TP profile will adjust itself such that these temperatures are cool (<1000K), which in turn results in mixing ratios of methane, thermochemically at solar composition, that would present in the WFC3 spectrum.  We suggest the reviewer review Lodders et al. 2002 for the influence of temperature and pressure on the abundances of CH4 and CO.  Again, with regaurd to a thermal inversion, certainly a planet may have one, but over the WFC3 bandpass the temperatures in such an inversion would have to be cool enough (to make the scale height match the spectral amplitude) to the point where methane would still be abundant. E.g., a strong inversion could not exist otherwise the spectral features would be too large given the range of metallicities (up to 100x solar) explored by the un-restricted retrieval.  We are unclear what how clouds will play a role in our TP profile. Yes, we understand that clouds can change the shape of a PT profile radiatively in a consistent sense, however the TP profiles explored explore a sufficiently wide range of temperatures in the regions probed by the transit spectrum.  Again, detailed PT profile structure information is not available from limited wavelength transmission spectra, so adding a more complex parameterization will effectively, do nothing. The temperatures will still be constrained to what is shown in Figure 4.

3) Next, stating that the photosphere is at 10 mbar, while implying from the current retrieval analysis that there is a cloud deck between 0.1 and 1 mbar (at 1-sgima) is inconsistent and misleading. The authors need to compare their methane abundance to the expected methane abundances for a range of plausible Tp profiles at 0.1 mbar and above. That is where the observations are sensitive to methane, not at 10 mbar. This will likely change their conclusion about the depletion or non-depletion of methane. Hence, the wording "methane depletion" is misleading.

  


4) My previous report stated "it appears unwise to constrain the atmospheric retrieval analysis to metallicities smaller than 30 times solar. This is true in particular because the probability distribution from the retrieval analysis rises sharply towards this upper bound. Considering all metallicities up 1000 times solar would be extremely helpful to understand whether the atmospheric models support the statement of low metallicities or not. Does the transmission spectrum in any way support the statement of low metallicity? Consistent results from interior modeling and the transmission spectrum would be reassuring and strength the letter. Also, what are the constraints on clouds and C/O when higher metallicities are considered?"
The authors provide a short response, but do not answer the questions and only refer back to the already existing text. What are the constraints at higher metallicities without a prior on metallicity?

My Response
We already stated this in the text. Given no interior constraint prior on the metallicity, metalliciites do not exceed ~200x in the retrieval.  The low C/O constraint remains.

*laura, attached is the un-restricted metalicity prior case if you want to overplot on the histograms (though I think you have it). I think this is the only way for them to get it.

6) In addition, showing that three analysis provided same results is good, but not sufficient given that they are extremely similar analysis. Can you please provide an atmospheric retrieval analysis with less restrictive models that explicitly excludes the HST orbit affected by the star spot crossing event? That would be a better test than saying that three very similar analysis result in the same spectrum.

My Response
NO
