COMMENTS:
1) I would also quote a metallicity upper limit with a 5 M_Earth core.  Maybe even in the abstract.  The 30X limit is of course for a core-free planet, which I don't think that anyone would find believable.  I understand that you want to quote something like a hard upper limit, and the core-free model gives you that.

2) Is there room for another figure?  Like a cloud-free model, and Caroline-cloudy model, compared to the observations?  I think it would be interesting.

3) You don't reference Wakeford's HAT-P-26 paper.  Not cool.  ;)  [Bullet 1 of the conclusions here?  That paper came to the same point]  

4) Is there a trend regarding hot Neptune radii (at a given mass) and atmospheric metallicity?  Larger radii and lower metallicities!  I bet there is!  (Was that already in your paper with Ian?)  If not, I'd look into that.
